                I have just finished working on several software engineering applications- my favorite technologies are front end technologies like React and its testing frameworks, but I particularly enjoy working on optimizing backend Relational Databases like mySQL and Postgres. For example, I recently worked on horizontally scaling an Amazon Web Services microservice to take in a large RPS which mainly required optimizing database queries. I really enjoy coding- particularly working on teams while also working solo.

                I am kind, compassionate, empathetic and a good listener. I have a background in secular Buddhism, and have worked on compassionate and mindful teams in eldercare for the past two years. I value self care but I also like going in hard. Iâ€™ve trained for and ran a marathon, and also was a competitive swimmer in college and now. I also have lived in two foreign countries and have visited 32 others.
